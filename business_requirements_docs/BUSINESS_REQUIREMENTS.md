# üéØ Flow App - Business Requirements Document
*Updated for Flow v4.3 - Flexible Period System Revolution*

---

## Executive Summary

Flow is not just another budgeting app‚Äîit's a **financial empowerment platform** that transforms financial anxiety into financial confidence through behavioral psychology and the proprietary **Flow Method**. Built on the principle that financial wellness should feel empowering rather than restrictive, Flow eliminates traditional budgeting complexity with a three-category system that guides users toward guilt-free spending while automatically building wealth.

### üÜï v4.3 Revolutionary Update: Flexible Period System
Flow v4.3 introduces the **first budgeting system designed specifically for the gig economy**, supporting weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly income cycles with custom start date alignment. This addresses the critical gap in financial tools for modern flexible work patterns, making Flow the premier choice for freelancers, gig workers, and anyone with non-traditional income schedules.

### Core Value Proposition
**"Your money, clarified. One simple number tells you what you can spend guilt-free."**

Flow addresses the fundamental problem with traditional budgeting apps: they make people feel guilty about spending and overwhelmed by complexity. Instead, Flow provides *clarity* through the Flow Method (Foundation/Future/Freedom) and empowers users with a single daily number they can spend without guilt or calculation.

### üÜï v4.3 Enhanced Value Proposition  
**"Financial freedom that adapts to YOUR life - weekly paychecks, gig work, or monthly salary."**

Flow v4.3 extends this clarity to modern work patterns by automatically adjusting calculations to your actual income schedule. Whether you're paid weekly from gig work, bi-weekly from employment, or monthly from contracts, Flow calculates your daily spending amount based on YOUR real timeline, eliminating the frustration of forcing irregular income into monthly budget constraints.
