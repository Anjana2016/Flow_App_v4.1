# üéØ Flow App - Business Requirements Document
*Reverse Engineered from Flow v4.2 Implementation*

---

## Executive Summary

Flow is not just another budgeting app‚Äîit's a **financial empowerment platform** that transforms financial anxiety into financial confidence through behavioral psychology and the proprietary **Flow Method**. Built on the principle that financial wellness should feel empowering rather than restrictive, Flow eliminates traditional budgeting complexity with a three-category system that guides users toward guilt-free spending while automatically building wealth.

### Core Value Proposition
**"Your money, clarified. One simple number tells you what you can spend guilt-free."**

Flow addresses the fundamental problem with traditional budgeting apps: they make people feel guilty about spending and overwhelmed by complexity. Instead, Flow provides *clarity* through the Flow Method (Foundation/Future/Freedom) and empowers users with a single daily number they can spend without guilt or calculation.
