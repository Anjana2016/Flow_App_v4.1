            <button class="btn-primary">Learn More</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

**Content Migration Strategy**:

**Spend Tab Help Icons**:
| Current Tooltip | Help Icon Modal Content |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| `daily-flow-amount` | **"Daily Flow Philosophy"**<br>*"Your daily flow amount is designed for guilt-free spending. It's calculated automatically from your Flow Method allocation, ensuring you can spend freely today while building wealth for tomorrow. This amount updates in real-time with each purchase, giving you instant confidence in every spending decision."* |
| `quick-add-system` | **"Smart Spending Categories"**<br>*"These six categories capture 80% of typical spending patterns. Coffee (~$5), Food (~$15), Transport (~$10), Shopping (~$30), Fun (~$20) are rounded to multiples of $5 for easy mental math. The 'Oops' button removes shame from forgotten transactions - honest tracking builds better habits."* |
| `location-features` | **"Location Intelligence"**<br>*"Based on your location, Flow suggests nearby places with typical spending amounts. This reduces decision fatigue and speeds up transaction entry. Amounts are based on real spending patterns at each location."* |

**Flow Tab Help Icons**:
| Current Tooltip | Help Icon Modal Content |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| `foundation-philosophy` | **"Foundation Philosophy"**<br>*"Foundation (30-80% of income) builds your security base. This isn't just an emergency fund - it's your confidence foundation. Every dollar here creates options, reduces anxiety, and enables you to take smart risks. Security enables opportunity."* |
| `future-strategy` | **"Future Growth Strategy"**<br>*"Future (0-30% of income) builds automatically toward your goals. This systematic approach removes the stress of 'finding money' for important things. Your Europe trip, house down payment, or career change fund grows without you thinking about it."* |
| `freedom-psychology` | **"Freedom Psychology"**<br>*"Freedom (auto-calculated) is your guilt-free spending amount. Because Foundation and Future are handled systematically, every dollar here can be spent without worry. This creates the psychological freedom that makes wealth building sustainable."* |

**Build Tab Help Icons**:
| Current Tooltip | Help Icon Modal Content |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| `smart-choices-growth` | **"Building Mindful Habits"**<br>*"Smart Choices tracks your mindful spending decisions. Each day you stay within your daily flow builds a stronger wealth-building habit. This isn't about restriction - it's about building the automatic behaviors that create lasting financial freedom."* |
| `flow-mastery-progress` | **"Flow Method Mastery"**<br>*"Flow Mastery measures how well you're implementing the Foundation/Future/Freedom system. Mastery comes from consistent allocation management, goal integration, and using your daily flow confidently. This is the psychology that separates wealth builders from spenders."* |
| `real-money-built` | **"Wealth Building Progress"**<br>*"Real Money Built tracks actual dollars toward financial freedom. Unlike arbitrary points or levels, these are real milestones: $100 Foundation, $500 Security, $1000 Freedom. Each milestone unlocks genuine life options and reduces financial stress."* |

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All mobile interactions work smoothly without tooltip interference
- [ ] Help icons provide educational value without overwhelming interface
- [ ] Educational modals load quickly and provide genuine insight
- [ ] Content maintains authentic Flow voice and "Clarity Guide" personality

        position: 'top-center',
        animation: 'slide-down'
    });
    
    // Track coaching moment for frequency management
    trackCoachingMoment(trigger, userContext);
}

function getCoachingContent(trigger, userContext) {
    const baseContent = coachingDatabase[trigger];
    
    // Personalize content based on user context
    return {
        ...baseContent,
