## 🔧 Core Technologies

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript
- **Storage**: Browser LocalStorage API
- **Design**: Modern glassmorphism UI with responsive design
- **Architecture**: Session-based state management with dual display system

## 💡 Key Innovations

### Dual Display System
The app implements a unique dual display system that:
- Tracks real-time spending with `todayFlowed` accumulator
- Shows remaining budget as `dailyFlow - todayFlowed`
- Prevents calculation conflicts with session protection
- Allows negative values when overspending

### Session Protection
Intelligent session management that:
- Detects active spending sessions
- Prevents automatic recalculation during use
- Extends sessions on user activity
- Automatically ends after 15 minutes of inactivity

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing tools:

1. **Open `validation_test.html`** for interactive testing
2. **Use browser console** for manual validation:
   ```javascript
   validateDailySpendingImplementation()
   testTransactionProcessing()
   calculateExpectedTodayFlowed()
   ```

## 🔄 Recent Updates (v4.2)

- ✅ Added session protection to prevent calculation conflicts
- ✅ Enhanced transaction processing with `todayFlowed` tracking
- ✅ Fixed display functions to show negative values when overspending
- ✅ Improved error handling and validation
- ✅ Added comprehensive testing suite

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Mathematical Model
The app uses a sophisticated daily flow calculation:
```javascript
dailyFlow = (monthlyIncome * freedomPercentage) / daysInMonth
remainingToday = dailyFlow - todayFlowed
```

### Session Management
```javascript
// Session automatically starts on transaction
startActiveSession()
// Extends on activity
extendActiveSession() 
// Ends after 15 minutes inactivity
endActiveSession()
```

### Data Persistence
All user data is stored locally using the browser's LocalStorage API, ensuring privacy and immediate access.
