```
Title: "Your Daily Flow"

Subtitle: "Guilt-free spending made simple"

Sections:
1. Challenge: "Most budget apps make you calculate what you can spend every single day. Math, stress, guilt when you get it wrong."

3. Highlight: "Zero Daily Math Required"
   Content: "That means you can spend your daily flow amount completely guilt-free, knowing your Foundation and Future are already handled systematically."

4. Benefit: "Confidence in Every Purchase"
   Icon: ‚ú®
   Content: "No more wondering 'Can I afford this?' Your daily flow amount is designed for spending. When it's there, spend it. When it's not, you'll know exactly why."
```

```
Title: "Foundation, Future, Freedom"
Icon: üåä
Subtitle: "The psychology behind Flow's three-category system"

```

```
Title: "Your Growth Story"
Icon: üå±

Sections:
1. Challenge: "Other apps celebrate hitting arbitrary milestones and earning fake points. Level up! Achievement unlocked! But real wealth building isn't a game."

3. Highlight: "Real Impact"
