# 🚀 Flow v4.2 - Production Ready Release

## ✨ Major Achievements
- **Complete onboarding integration** between standalone and main app
- **Resolved localStorage data flow issues** with fresh onboarding detection
- **Production-ready code quality** with debug logging cleanup
- **Enhanced user experience** with seamless app transitions

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Onboarding Integration
- Fixed income transfer from onboarding to main app
- Implemented fresh data detection system (`onboardingComplete && !welcomeShown`)
