v4.2: Implement Dual Display System & Session Protection

## 🚀 Major Features
- **Dual Display System**: Real-time spending tracking with todayFlowed accumulator
- **Session Protection**: 15-minute inactivity timer prevents calculation conflicts
- **Negative Value Display**: Shows overspending amounts instead of capping at zero
- **Enhanced Transaction Processing**: Live tracking without recalculation conflicts

## 🔧 Technical Improvements
- Added startActiveSession(), extendActiveSession(), endActiveSession() functions
- Modified processTransaction() to update todayFlowed directly
- Updated updateDailyFlowDisplay() and updateAllDisplaysSynchronized() for consistency
- Protected recalculateTodayFlowed() with session state checking
- Added page visibility handlers for session management

## 🧪 Testing & Validation
- Created comprehensive validation_test.html testing interface
- Added daily_spending_validation.js with testing functions
- Implemented real-time accuracy checking and debugging tools
- Added browser console validation commands

## 📚 Documentation
- Added detailed README.md with project overview and technical details
- Documented dual display system architecture
- Included quick start guide and file structure
- Added testing instructions and troubleshooting

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed display functions showing zero instead of negative values
- Resolved timing conflicts between live tracking and recalculation
- Aligned calculation methods across all display functions
- Improved error handling and edge case management

## 🎯 User Experience
- Removed Math.max(0, ...) constraint to show overspending
- Enhanced quick add modal with remaining/overspent status
- Improved visual feedback for spending state
- Added contextual messages for budget status

This update completes the surgical implementation of tracking daily spending
instead of recalculating, providing users with accurate real-time feedback
while maintaining data integrity through intelligent session management.
